				<p>Hello. The site probably isn't up yet.</p>
				<p>A little lore. As with pretty much anyone to ever make a website (that I know of), I've made a lot of attempts at it. None turned out how I really wanted it to, but I think I have something good going with this one.</p>
				<p>Currently, I'm writing raw HTML into Vim. I'll definitely be making something that <em>vaguely</em> resembles a static site generator soon.</p>
				<h2><time>Evening of June 6, 2023</time> (again!)</h2>
				<p>Wow, that was quick. GitHub Pages is not very painful, it seems.</p>
