<p>
	<b>m4</b> is a general-purpose macro processor included in most Unix-like operating systems, and is a component of the POSIX standard.
</p>
<p>
	The language was designed by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie for the original versions of UNIX. It is an extension of an earlier macro processor, <b>m3</b>, written by Ritchie for an unknown AP-3 minicomputer.
</p>
<p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
	The macro preprocessor operates as a text-replacement tool. It is employed to re-use text templates, typically in computer programming applications, but also in text editing and text-processing applications. Most users require m4 as a dependency of GNU autoconf.
